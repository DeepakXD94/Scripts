# Project A : My Project (mission) to reduce the no. of icons on the screeen and make the wallpaper viewable.

This project is to reduce the no. of shortcut icons on my computer screen and make it look beautiful. I assign keywords to all my regularly used apps and access them using the code in this project files. 

## V2 : What's different :
*  Using functions and modules to store and retrieve keywords and their respective filepaths from distinct files based on their nature (work folder, apps, browsers etc.)
